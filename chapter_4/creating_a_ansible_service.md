## Creating a Ansible Service

Ansible is the main pillar for the automation and playbooks are its essential part. Till now we have seen the Enabling of Ansible in ManageIQ, To get the entire picture lets walk through it.

In our case we will be working on creation of a External Network. We can choose any functionality and write a playbook for it.

### Service Creation

As till now you have done with the integration and enabling of EmbeddedAnsible, now it was time for the actual working for the end user view set.

#### Creating and Importing Service Dialog

1. Moving ahead, you need to navigate from **Automation &rarr; Automate &rarr; Customization**.

2. You will land on page where you need to import the service dialog.

3. Choose the Dialog file from the playbook in the *choose file* field.

4. Import the choosen file.

You can view the service dialog in graphical view in the *Service Dialogs* section. You can see the list of service dialogs here and you can go through it by just on a click.

Here in our case, This service is for Creation of External Network that would collect the details from the user like Network name, OpenStack Host, Its credentials and SSL options.

### Ordering Service

So now you are almost done with everything like Dialog, Creating a catalog, Catalog item and now it is time to order our service. For this,
